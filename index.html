    <h2>What is Island Party?</h2>
    <p>
      Since the foundation of BYX at Texas A&amp;M in 1994, Beta Upsilon Chi Fraternity has hosted Island Party as our own way of giving back to the community. Although Island Party has grown and adapted over the years, its purpose remains the same: evangelism, philanthropy, fun, life-giving, and the bolstering of our own brotherhood and unity. Recently, Island Party has taken on the form of a music festivalâ€”an all-day, totally free concert with performances by talented musicians, a comfortable environment, games, food, opportunities for connections to be made, and great friends to share all of it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year we would like to invite you to Island Party 2014: a true musical festival, lasting two days. Join us Friday, March 28th for a ramped-up, high-energy night of hip-hop and rap. Then, come back on Saturday, March 29th, for a laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere to boot.

      It's not enough, but it's helping. And then another one. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan.
