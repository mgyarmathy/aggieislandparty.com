      Since the foundation of BYX at Texas A&amp;M in 1994, Beta Upsilon Chi Fraternity has hosted Island Party as our own way of giving back to the community. Although Island Party has grown and adapted over the years, its purpose remains the same: evangelism, philanthropy, fun, life-giving, and the bolstering of our own brotherhood and unity. Recently, Island Party has taken on the form of a music festival—a totally free concert with performances by talented musicians, a comfortable environment, games, food, opportunities for connections to be made, and great friends to share all of it with.

    <p>
      This year we would like to invite you to Island Party 2015. Join us Friday, April 24th for a laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere to boot.

    <h3>About Beta Upsilon Chi (BYX)</h3>
    <p class="meta">
      Beta Upsilon Chi started at the University of Texas in Austin during the spring semester of 1985. A group of college men set out to establish an alternative to the present fraternal lifestyle. It was the vision of the founding fathers to have a fraternity of committed Christian men, based on the unique brotherhood that a Christian atmosphere affords, for the purpose of fellowship and glorification of Jesus Christ. The Brothers press on toward the mark of the high Calling.
